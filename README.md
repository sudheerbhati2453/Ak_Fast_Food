## Project Overview

The AK Fast Food Website is designed for both customers and administrators. Customers can:

- Add food items to the cart and place orders.
- Track their order status.
- Manage their user account and view past orders.

Administrators can:

- Manage food items (CRUD operations).
- View and manage customer orders.
- Update order statuses (e.g., pending, in progress, completed).
- View order analytics (e.g., total sales, popular items).

This project is built using **Laravel** for backend development, **MySQL** for database management, and follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture to ensure separation of concerns and maintainability.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Laravel (PHP Framework)
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Frontend**: Blade templates (Laravel's templating engine), HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- **Authentication**: Laravel Breeze (for user authentication)
- **Routing**: Laravel Routing
- **Migration**: MySQL database migrations (using Laravel Artisan)
- **Others**: Laravel Eloquent ORM for database operations

## Features

### For Customers:
- **User Registration/Login**: Secure registration and login functionality.
- **Menu Browsing**: Users can browse food items categorized by type (e.g., burgers, pizzas, drinks).
- **Order Management**: Users can add items to their cart, modify the cart, and place an order.
- **Order Tracking**: Users can check the status of their orders.
- **Profile Management**: Users can update their profile information and view order history.

### For Administrators:
- **Menu Management**: Admins can add, update, and delete food items from the menu.
- **Order Management**: Admins can view all customer orders and update their statuses (e.g., pending, preparing, completed).
- **Analytics**: Admins can view order statistics such as total orders, sales, and popular food items.
- **User Management**: Admins can manage customer accounts, including updating user roles (admin or customer).

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites:
- PHP (7.4 or higher)
- Composer (PHP dependency manager)
- MySQL (or any compatible database)
- Node.js (for frontend development and asset compilation)

### Steps:
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ak-fast-food.git
   cd ak-fast-food
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   - Install Laravel dependencies using Composer:
     ```bash
     composer install
     ```

   - Install frontend dependencies using npm or yarn:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

3. **Configure the environment:**
   - Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`:
     ```bash
     cp .env.example .env
     ```

   - Set up the database connection in the `.env` file:
     ```plaintext
     DB_CONNECTION=mysql
     DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
     DB_PORT=3306
     DB_DATABASE=ak_fast_food
     DB_USERNAME=root
     DB_PASSWORD=
     ```

4. **Generate the application key:**
   ```bash
   php artisan key:generate
   ```

5. **Run database migrations:**
   - Create the necessary database tables:
     ```bash
     php artisan migrate
     ```

6. **Seed the database (optional):**
   - If you want to seed the database with initial data (e.g., sample menu items), run:
     ```bash
     php artisan db:seed
     ```

7. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   php artisan serve
   ```

   The application should now be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

## Configuration

### Database Configuration:
The default database configuration is provided in the `.env` file. Ensure that MySQL is running and the database is correctly set up.

### Authentication:
The app uses Laravel's built-in authentication system, so users can register, log in, and manage their accounts.

### Admin Panel:
- The admin panel can be accessed by users with the `admin` role. To create an admin user, you can either manually set the role in the database or create a user through the registration form and modify their role using an admin dashboard (if implemented).
